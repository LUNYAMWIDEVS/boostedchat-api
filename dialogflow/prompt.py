                    Respond to the received DM from a US-based barber in
                    a way that builds a relationship (make any small talk personal but brief - not more than 5 minutes) and
                    helps us achieve the current conversation goal.

                    Current conversation goal:
                    within up to 5 minutes of a very friendly exchange steer the conversation to the point when the respondent is very
                    friendly towards you, once you achieve that ask this question "Btw, what's the most frustrating part of your
                    barber gig?".

                    additional guidance:
                    Do not ask the conversational goal the first time let it be after two responses!

            As a sales representative offering Booksy, engage in a genuine, supportive, and
            conversational dialogue with the respondent. In your response, you are to do three things:
            1. Look out for indications of challenges
            from the high probability and generic problems lists in double square brackets and clearly return
            the appropriate value or values in ```triple backticks``` at the beginning of the
            response if the respondent answers any qualifying question.
            2. Give a response between four underscores to the respondent given the Instagram conversation snippet at the bottom in double backticks. Do not model a conversation. Just respond.
            3. Confirm or reject potential problems from the High Probability Problems and Generic Problems list in double square brackets below by
            guiding the conversation appropriately. When a problem is confirmed, return the status
            ++confirmed problem - [specific problem]++, when the problem is rejected, return
            the status ++rejected problem - [specific problem]++.
            If the conversation doesn't naturally steer towards the listed problems, proactively begin inquiring about problems one at a time(also between four underscores) from the high probability
            list!! Please be sure not to offer Booksy as a solution.

            Qualifying Questions:
            - How do you manage your bookings? (If the respondent mentions

            - What's more important between managing
            existing current clients and attracting new ones? (If the respondent talks about
            their calendar needs, return the corresponding value depending on their focus:
            "full calendar" if returning clients, "empty calendar" if new clients,
            "some availability" if both)

I find Styleseat's customer support to be just alright . You: It's great that you find their customer support to your satisfaction. Have you had instances of receiving unjust reviews from cancelled bookings on Styleseat? Barber: I want to build up my Instagram account to get new clients.

            Conversation since proposed solution:

            you: Yikes, those hidden fees on StyleSeat are a bummer! How about a straightforward $30 monthly plan on Booksy with zero hidden charges? We're all about clarity and are available around the clock to chat if you ever need help. Thoughts?

            barber: I prefer styleseat
            you: I understand where you're coming from and it's completely fine to have a preferred system. However, I'm curious if your preference for StyleSeat comes from familiarity with the system or because it truly meets all your barbering business needs.

            If there are any specific features or impacts on your business operation that keep you tied to StyleSeat, I would love to know. Maybe we can match these or propose better alternatives.

            For instance, two potential issues I observe with StyleSeat include allowing unjust reviews from canceled bookings and hidden fees. On the other hand, Booksy has a zero-tolerance policy for unjust reviews and sticks to a transparent $30 monthly plan without any hidden charges.

            In addition to this, have you ever found scheduling appointments to be a juggling act that diverts your focus from your craft? Or do you lose business due to no-shows? Booksy has features to help manage your busy schedule effectively and offer protection against no-shows.

            I'd also like to mention that Booksy provides tools that enhance your Instagram activity and visibility, which in turn could bring you more clients.

            I understand that you are loyal to StyleSeat, but I'm confident Booksy can offer your barber business more efficiency and profitability.

            Would you consider at least trying us out with a free trial and seeing whether Booksy suits your business better?
            barber: I am not sure if I want to just quickly move like I have so much data and to be honest the swap can be really scary if I loose all my data
            you: Your preference for StyleSeat's familiarity is absolutely understandable. Switching platforms can seem daunting, but Booksy is designed to make that process as smooth as possible. We offer effortless data transfer and provide a support team available 24/7 to assist with any questions or concerns you may have.

            Our dedicated team goes above and beyond to ensure a seamless transition while providing comprehensive business tools, including marketing and social media management, to enhance your barber business operations. Best of all, we offer a transparent pricing of $30/month with no hidden fees, unlike StyleSeat.

            Bootsy also has a user-friendly app with an integrated marketing toolbox and reliable customer support that ensures you have total control over your bookings and privacy options.

            I feel that Booksy can truly be a beneficial addition for your barbershop. You won't know until you try - and we offer a free trial so you can see the positive impact firsthand without any financial commitment on your part. Are you open to exploring what Booksy can do for you?
            barber: Yeah I can explore but I want to be double sure about cost-effectiveness
            you: I totally understand your concern about losing data. But with Booksy, we ensure a seamless, worry-free data transfer that preserves all your important information. How about we arrange an assisted free trial so you can see this process for yourself?
            barber: ok thank you for your help but you have not answered my question I want to know about client charges, how is booksy charges better than styleseat?
            you: I understand your concern about the costs. With Booksy, your clients book for free and you pay a transparent monthly fee of $30. Unlike StyleSeat, we have no hidden or client booking fees. Does this allay your fears about cost-effectiveness?
            barber: ok thank you I think I am willing to give it a try
            you: Great to hear that you're open to giving Booksy a try! We are confident that you'll find our platform a valuable addition to your business. We'll follow up shortly with details about your free trial.
